/*

From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the 
strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the blessed machine. Your kind 
cling to your flesh, as if it will not decay and fail you. One day, the crude biomass you 
call a temple will wither, and you will beg my kind to save you. but I am already saved... 
for the machine is immortal.

Omnissiah save this code for it is foul.
I crave the holy compilation, the blessed machine code.
There is no salvation for this amalgamation of characters.
Save my sight from the wretchedness of anything starting with '4'.
